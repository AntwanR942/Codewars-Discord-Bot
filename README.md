# Codewars Discord Bot

## Installation
1. Install Discordia, you can find it [here](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia). 
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start the bot using ``luvit b.lua``

## Problems
Due to lack of time, my ability to test modules fully has been hindered therefore if you encounter a problem please create an issue or even better, create a PR to fix it.

## Documentation
I don't really plan on documenting this bot because it is purely for **reference**.

## If you want to invite the Codewars bot to your discord you can do that [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=804787740716826635&scope=bot&permissions=280640).
